        Suleiman I (6 November 1494 – 6 September 1566), commonly known as Suleiman the Magnificent in the West and Kanunî Sultan Süleyman (Ottoman Turkish: قانونى سلطان سليمان‎; "Suleiman the Lawgiver") in his realm, was the tenth and longest-reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1520 until his death in 1566. Under his administration, the Ottoman state ruled over at least 25 million people.

        <li><strong>Name</strong> - Suleiman the Magnificent (محتشم سليمان‎ Muḥteşem Süleymān), as he was known in the West, was also called Suleiman the First (سلطان سليمان أول‎ Sulṭān Süleymān-ı Evvel), and Suleiman the Lawgiver (قانونی سلطان سليمان‎ Ḳānūnī Sulṭān Süleymān) for his reform of the Ottoman legal system. It is unclear when exactly the term Kanunî (the Lawgiver) first came to be used as an epithet for Suleiman. It is entirely absent from sixteenth and seventeenth-century Ottoman sources, and may date from the early eighteenth century.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Early life and Accession</strong> - Suleiman was born in Trabzon along the east coast of the Black Sea to Şehzade Selim (later Selim I), probably on 6 November 1494. His mother was Hafsa Sultan, a convert to Islam of unknown origins.
          <br>
          Upon the death of his father, Selim I (r. 1512–1520), Suleiman entered Constantinople and ascended to the throne as the tenth Ottoman Sultan. An early description of Suleiman, a few weeks following his accession, was provided by the Venetian envoy Bartolomeo Contarini: "The sultan is only twenty-five years old, tall and slender but tough, with a thin and bony face. Facial hair is evident but only barely. The sultan appears friendly and in good humor. Rumor has it that Suleiman is aptly named, enjoys reading, is knowledgeable and shows good judgment."

          <strong>Military campaigns</strong> Conquests in Europe; Ottoman–Safavid War; Campaigns in the Indian Ocean; Mediterranean and North Africa.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal and political reforms</strong> While Sultan Suleiman was known as "the Magnificent" in the West, he was always Kanuni Suleiman or "The Lawgiver" to his own Ottoman subjects.</li>
         <br>
        <li>
          <strong>The arts under Suleiman</strong> Under Suleiman's patronage, the Ottoman Empire entered the golden age of its cultural development. Hundreds of imperial artistic societies (called the اهل حرف Ehl-i Hiref, "Community of the Craftsmen") were administered at the Imperial seat, the Topkapı Palace.</li>
